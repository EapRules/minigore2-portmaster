/*
 * Framebuffer probe: does the game actually draw anything?
 *
 * This is the one check that a stub cannot pass by accident. Every other
 * milestone can be reached by a shim that answers "fine" to everything - the
 * module loads, onCreate returns, a context appears, swaps happen - and the
 * result is a black screen that looks perfect in the logs. So the pixels get
 * read back and the port has to prove it painted something.
 *
 * Three constraints shape it:
 *
 *  - It runs on the GAME's thread, from inside eglSwapBuffers, because that is
 *    the thread that owns the context. The loader's thread has none.
 *  - It reads BEFORE the swap. After SDL_GL_SwapWindow the back buffer is
 *    undefined by specification, and under llvmpipe it really is.
 *  - It latches. glReadPixels flushes the whole pipeline, which is brutal on a
 *    software rasteriser inside qemu, so once a non-black frame is seen the
 *    probe switches itself off for the rest of the run and costs nothing.
 *
 * The probe leaves GL exactly as it found it (framebuffer binding, pack
 * alignment) with one honest exception: it cannot restore a pending GL error,
 * so it drains the error queue around itself and says so if it found one.
