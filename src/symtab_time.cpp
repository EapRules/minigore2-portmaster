/*
 * 32-bit time_t, because the game has one and the host does not.
 *
 * Debian trixie moved armhf to 64-bit time_t. bionic's armeabi-v7a time_t
 * stayed 32-bit, and Minigore 2 was compiled against it. Binding the game's
 * clock_gettime straight to the host's - which is what the generated bionic
 * table does, and what works on distros that have not made the switch - hands
 * the kernel a 16-byte struct timespec to fill in where the game reserved 8:
 *
 *     xt::Time::getSeconds():
 *         sub  sp, #16
 *         str  <canary>, [sp, #12]
 *         add  r1, sp, #4        ; struct timespec
 *         blx  clock_gettime
 *
 * The extra eight bytes land on the stack canary and the process dies in
 * __stack_chk_fail before the game has drawn anything. It is not a subtle
 * failure, but it is a silent one: nothing in the log points at time_t.
 *
 * Every function here therefore takes the game's layout, calls the host with
 * the host's, and narrows across the boundary. These entries come before the
 * generated libc table in so_dynamic_libraries so they win the lookup.
 *
 * Narrowing is lossless until 2038; past that the game sees a wrapped clock,
 * exactly as it would on a real armeabi-v7a device.
