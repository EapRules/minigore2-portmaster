# Autonomous verification harness for the Minigore 2 port.
#
# This is what lets the loop run without a human: it builds the armhf loader,
# runs it under qemu-arm with software GLES2, and decides objectively which
# milestone the port currently reaches. No console, no SD card, no eyeballs.
#
# Exit code = highest milestone passed (0 = nothing builds). The loop reads it
# to know whether the last iteration moved forward, stalled, or regressed.
#
# Usage:  harness/verify.sh [--milestone N] [--timeout SECS]

# That was too weak and it passed a port that was not working: the engine booted
# and cleared the screen to a colour, but opened 0 assets, linked 0 GLSL programs
# and issued 0 draw calls. A solid-colour clear is indistinguishable from a
# rendered game by the pixel test alone.
#
# So M6 now demands evidence that the engine got past initialisation and is
# drawing its own content. These thresholds are deliberately far above what an
# init path can produce by accident:
#   assets   - the game has 1180 of them; loading a level touches dozens
#   programs - the engine builds a shader program per material
#   draws    - one frame of gameplay is many draw calls
#
# The loader must emit, at the end of the run:
#   TRACE: summary assets=<n> programs=<n> draws=<n>
